Gesucht: 
Minimales Programm zum testen des Programmers bzw. Debuggers auf dem gegebenen Board mit reinen Maschinenbefehlen umgesetzt um mögliche Fehlerquellen zu umgehen. Um bei eineren späteren Umstellung auf eine IDE mit Compiler mit mit den architekturspezifischen Eigenheiten und Problemen gezielt umgehen zu können bzw. sie schnell mit Reverse-Engineering Methoden wie z.B. gezieltes Debugging oder Tracing zu analyisieren und dabei die typische Fehlerzustände zu kennen.

Cortex M3 Arch Family details:
The processor uses a full descending stack. Th
is means the stack pointer indicates the last 
stacked item on the stack memory. 

Stackpointer = R13
Link Register = R14
if R13[1] == 0 then
  MSP is used
else 
  PSP (Process Stack Pointer) is used

Boot         modes
At startup, boot pins are used to select one of three boot options:
• Boot from User Flash
• Boot from System Memory
• Boot from embedded SRAM
The boot loader is located in System Memory. 
It is used to reprogram the Flash memory by using USART1. For further details please refer to AN2606.
Stop Mode can stop the crystal oscillator, Sleep mode only when enabled and no interrupt occur, Standby SRAM and registers lost except in the backup domain and Standby circuitry
RTC default: 1 Sekunde über 32.768 kHz mit 20 bit prescalers bei 128er Teilung (intern nur 40 kHz). Kalibrierung über 512 Hz Output.

Entweder SWJ-DP oder JTAG - SWDIO und SWCLK wird mit TMS und TCK pins geteilt. Sequence um TMS pin umzuschalten ist notwendig (siehe OpenOCD TCL-Scripts).
The Flash access time is adjusted to f HCLK frequency (0 wait state from 0 to 24 MHz, 1 wait state from 24 to 48 MHz and 2 wait states above).
Crystal osc average startup time 2ms
bis zu 60 Sekunden (im absoluten Worst-Case RTC Startup Time)

Software recommendations
The software flowchart must include the management of runaway conditions such as:
• Corrupted program counter
•Unexpected reset
•Critical Data corruption (control registers...) (z.B. über CRC-Peripherie?)

Prequalification trialsMost of the common failures (unexpected reset and program counter corruption) can be 
reproduced by manually forcing a low state on the NRST pin or the Oscillator pins for 1 
second.To complete these trials, ESD stress can be applied directly on the device, over the range of 
specification values. When unexpected behavior is detected, the software can be hardened 
to prevent unrecoverable errors occurring (see application note AN1015).

Nested vectored interrupt controller (NVIC)
The STM32F103xx performance line embeds a ne
sted vectored interrupt controller able to 
handle up to 43 maskable interrupt channels (not including the 16 interrupt lines of Cortex

M3) and 16 priority levels.
Closely coupled NVIC gives low-latency interrupt processing
Interrupt entry vector table address passed directly to the cores
Closely coupled NVIC core interface
Allows early processing of interrupts
Processing of 
late arriving
 higher priority interrupts
Support for tail-chaining
•
Processor state automatically saved
•
Interrupt entry restored on interrupt exit with no instruction overhead


Independent watchdog
The independent watchdog is based on a 12-bit downcounter and 8-bit prescaler. It is 
clocked from an independent 40 kHz internal RC
 and as it operates independently of the 
main clock, it can operate in Stop and Stan
dby modes. It can be used either as a watchdog 
to reset the device when a problem occurs, or as a free-running timer for application timeout 
management. It is hardware- or software-configurable through the option bytes. The counter 
can be frozen in debug mode.

Achtung: Beim Debuggen und bei einigen Tests vorsichtshalber alles umgehen was irgendwie mit Watchdog-Abhängigkeiten zu tun hat!

Program memory, data memory, registers and I/O ports are organized within the same linear
4-Gbyte address space.
The bytes are coded in memory in Little Endian format. The lowest numbered byte in a word
is considered the word’s least significant byte and the highest numbered byte the most
significant.
For the detailed mapping of peripheral registers, please refer to the related chapters.
The addressable memory space is divided into 8 main blocks, each of 512 MB.
All the memory areas that are not allocated to on-chip memories and peripherals are
considered “Reserved”). Refer to the Memory map figure in the corresponding product
datasheet.
